We use SWMP datasets to support high school student investigations in Elkhorn Slough. We have about 12 high school student groups each year do investigations in the slough from two local high schools as part of a Monterey Bay Aquarium program to get underrepresented students doing science. Student groups are paired with science mentors to come up with investigative questions and carry out their investigations during the autumn (this year's group is doing this now). They are encouraged and taught how to use SWMP data which is used to support their research. Some of the projects have been presented at regional GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) Program Student Research Symposiums. This data is a stellar addition to their own data collection. We at Elkhorn Slough Reserve are hoping to have SWMP data entered into the GLOBE Program data archive for students to use in the US and around the world.    We also used SWMP reports to create data lessons involving data analysis. Some lessons have the students draw relationships among the variables (mostly water quality and meteorology), like DO and water temperature, or salinity and precipitation. Other lessons have the students assess whether certain species can live in certain locations based on water data or determine what might be the limiting factors for species absence. They compare data from different years to see how these variables are changing from one year to the next.    We include training on using SWMP in some of our teacher trainings. We have a one day training specifically about using SWMP data for data analysis and include how the students can compare data they collect on fieldtrips at the reserve using water quality kits to data taken at a nearby SWMP station. Once students collect data using water quality instruments we feel they will be more engaged in analyzing data sets from that location and perhaps be interested in comparing this data to data from other locations or reserves.",No,I need to look into this to see how it can be used in our education program.,,,,,,

",Yes,,I had one or two questions but was able to figure it out.,,It was difficult but I worked it out.,"There were certain things that did not seem to work well. For example, I thought the purpose of the Excel file to set up the Report template was to make it easier to ""tell R"" what figures/information you want where in the final report. However, when changing which output figures I wanted on Page 3 of the report in the Excel template, R had issues and nothing was produced on Page 3 of the template. I ended up having to export a basic Report template and modify the text and graphs by hand in PowerPoint because the automated R process did not work. It may have been due to the different ""sizes"" of the output figures and the formatting code that goes into the creation of the PowerPoint file. ","The ability to add different threshold values associated with multiple stations. At my Reserve, all of the SWMP stations are located within waterbodies of different state classifications. As such, the ""state standards"" for those waterbodies differs for EACH station. To create the Chlorophyll threshold criteria graphs associated with the appropriate value at each station, I had to change the line in the Excel parameters document and rerun the full code four separate times and remove the chlorophyll outputs from the folders before each go. It was cumbersome and not as streamlined of a workflow.  Also, there were certain data types that the figures did not work for. For example, the ""daily range"" seasonal line plots do not work for monthly nutrient samples. Could we remove certain legend items from figures?",I don't think I would get RID of anything. Just improve what is there.
